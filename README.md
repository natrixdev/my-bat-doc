  I'm going to explain how to learn the batch through examples that will increase in difficulty and complexity as you go through         this page.
 
 This "documentation" has been produced entirely by [natrix](https://github.com/natrixdev)

## Example #1 - Colors
This example will show you how to change the colour of the text displayed in the console. I will also give you a list of available colours.
 ```bat
color a 
pause 
```
For a greeen console<br>Available colours:
```
    0 = Black 8 = Grey
    1 = Blue 9 = Light blue
    2 = Green A = Light green
    3 = Blue-grey B = Cyan
    4 = Red C = Light red
    5 = Violet D = Light Violet
    6 = Yellow E = Light yellow
    7 = White F = Bright White
```
